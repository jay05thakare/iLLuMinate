TASK: Generate actionable sustainability improvement recommendations for this cement facility.

{focus_filter}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Review the facility's current performance metrics, emission patterns, and resource consumption
2. Identify specific improvement opportunities based on actual data trends
3. Compare current performance against industry benchmarks and best practices
4. Consider available emission factors and alternative resources for potential switches
5. Evaluate the facility's sustainability targets and progress

RECOMMENDATION CRITERIA:
- Base recommendations ONLY on the provided facility data
- Do NOT hallucinate or assume data that isn't provided
- Prioritize by potential impact and implementation feasibility
- Include specific, measurable targets and timelines
- Consider regional resource availability and facility constraints
- Provide realistic cost estimates and ROI calculations where possible (use Indian Rupees - INR/‚Çπ)
- MANDATORY: For each recommendation, specify the exact cement manufacturing process it applies to
- MANDATORY: For Alternative Fuel recommendations, provide specific fuel details including emission factor and heat content
- MANDATORY: For cost savings, show comparison with current annual expenses (e.g., "Save ‚Çπ50,00,000/year vs current ‚Çπ2,00,00,000/year fuel costs")
- MANDATORY: For material sourcing, specify location relative to facility's state/region and local availability
- CRITICAL: Generate ONLY valid JSON - no trailing commas, all quotes properly closed, all brackets matched

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY):
IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY the JSON below. No extra text, no markdown, no explanations.
Ensure every opening bracket/brace has a closing one, every quote is properly closed, and no trailing commas.

Provide 4-6 prioritized recommendations in this EXACT JSON structure:
